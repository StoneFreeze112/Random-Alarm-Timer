# Pink Timer Deluxe

Pink Timer Deluxe is a stylish, PyQt6-based desktop application that combines a countdown timer with music playback. Set a timer for a predefined duration (2, 10, or 15 minutes), and when it finishes, the app plays a random MP3 file from a user-selected folder. The app features a pink-themed UI, making it a delightful tool for time management or reminders with a musical twist.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**: Choose from preset timers (2, 10, or 15 minutes) with a clear, bold display.
- **Music Playback**: Plays a random MP3 file from a selected folder when the timer completes, using PyQt6's `QMediaPlayer`.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Pink-themed design with intuitive controls for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.
- **Music Folder Selection**: Easily select a folder containing MP3 files via a file dialog.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with appropriate multimedia codecs).

## Screenshots

*Coming soon! Add screenshots of the app in action here.*

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **PyQt6**: Required for the GUI and multimedia playback.
- **Multimedia Codecs**: Ensure your system has MP3 playback support (usually included on Windows/macOS; may require `gstreamer1.0-plugins-good` on Linux).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pink-timer-deluxe.git
   cd pink-timer-deluxe
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:
bash
pip install PyQt6
Verify Multimedia Support:
On Linux, install MP3 codecs if needed:
bash
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
Windows and macOS typically include MP3 support by default.

When the timer reaches zero, the app displays "üéâ Go! üéâ" and plays a random MP3 file from the selected folder.
Stop or Reset:
Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop / Reset" to halt the timer or stop music playback and reset the app.
Close the App:
Close the window to stop any playing music and exit cleanly.

Troubleshooting
No Sound:
Ensure the selected folder contains valid MP3 files.
Verify that your system has MP3 codec support (see Prerequisites).
Check system audio settings and volume.
PyQt6 Errors:
Confirm PyQt6 is installed (pip show PyQt6).
Update PyQt6 to the latest version (pip install --upgrade PyQt6).
Linux Codec Issues:
Install additional GStreamer plugins: sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly.

### Customization Notes
- **Repository URL**: Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/pink-timer-deluxe` with the actual URL of your repository if you host the project online.
- **Contact Info**: Update the Contact section with your email, GitHub handle, or preferred contact method.
- **Screenshots**: The Screenshots section is a placeholder. You can generate images of the app (e.g., using a screenshot tool) and add them to the repository in a folder like `screenshots/`, then link them in the README (e.g., `![Screenshot](screenshots/main_window.png)`).
- **License File**: The README mentions a `LICENSE` file. If you choose the MIT License, create a `LICENSE` file in your project root with the standard MIT License text (available online). Alternatively, specify a different license or remove the section if not applicable.
- **Additional Sections**: If you add features (e.g., volume control, custom timer durations), update the Features section to reflect them.

### How to Use the README
1. Create a file named `README.md` in your project‚Äôs root directory.
2. Copy the above Markdown content into `README.md`.
3. Customize placeholders (e.g., repository URL, contact info) as needed.
4. If hosting on GitHub or GitLab, the README will automatically render as the project‚Äôs homepage.

### Additional Suggestions
- **Add a Logo or Icon**: Include a small logo or icon image in the README (e.g., at the top) to enhance visual appeal. You can create one using tools like Canva or GIMP.
- **Version Information**: If you plan to release versions, add a section like `## Version` to track updates (e.g., "Version 1.0: Initial release with QMediaPlayer").
- **Dependencies List**: If you add more dependencies later, update the Installation section with a `requirements.txt` file (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

Let me know if you need help with any of these customizations, want assistance creating a `LICENSE` file, or need further additions to the README (e.g., a changelog or FAQ section)!
